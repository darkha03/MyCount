# This configuration runs ruff inside pre-commit-managed virtualenvs so no
# system-level `ruff` installation is required. The hooks are pinned to the
# same version declared in requirements-dev.txt.
# To enable locally:
# 1) Install dev requirements (which include pre-commit):
#    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# 2) Install the git hooks once:
#    pre-commit install
# 3) (Optional) Run hooks against all files:
#    pre-commit run --all-files
